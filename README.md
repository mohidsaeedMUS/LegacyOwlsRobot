# LegacyOwlsRobot
Our 9th Grade VEX Robot.

## What is the point of the repository?
The point of this repository is to provide the code of our robot to the teammates, so that they can access the code if I happen to be away from the competition.

## How do I obtain the code?
Click the big, green button that says 'Clone or Download' and click 'Download as a ZIP'. Then extract the downloaded file by right clicking on it, and open the code folder. Open the '.v5code' file in **VexCode V5 Text**, by following these steps:

- Open VCV5 
- Go to File > Open
- Navigate to the folder that contains the file appropriately named 'OkayBoomer.v5code' and open it.
