# LegacyOwlsRobot
Our 9th Grade VEX Robot.

## What is the point of the repository?
The point of this repository is to provide the code to my teammates so they can use the code while I'm away from the competition.

## How do I obtain the code?
Click the big, green button that says 'Clone or Download' and click 'Download as a ZIP'. Then extract the downloaded file by right clicking on it, and open the code folder. **This uses VEXCode V5 Text (VCV5)**: 

- Open VCV5 
- Go to File > Open
- Navigate to the folder that contains 'LegacyOwls.v5code'
- Open 'LegacyOwl.v5code'
